I've never had a blog before, so why am I starting one now? I'm excited about giving this a shot for a number of reasons:

- I'd like to get into the habit of writing things down in an effort to be more mindful and reflective of the things that are happening in my life.
- I'd like to give more structure to and organize my thoughts.
- As of now, the primary purpose is going to be to document my programming projects, write about the things I am learning and find interesting in the world of programming.

The scope of this blog might change in the future. Let's see how it goes.
